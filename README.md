Hello, I'm Fenix, a tera lover and a developer. I've been playing on Seren for 8 years and I recently moved to Mystel. 

Observation : BGs are now popping thanks to organized raid in Mystel Server and discord messages. However, a lot of people (PvP players, small guild, casual players, offline players or players in other servers) are missing these notifications or they are just not aware that battlegrounds are popping. 

Solution : That's why, to improve the communication and make BGs pop faster & last longer, I have created the Fenix Bot. It will announce when BGs are popping over all discord servers and update general status of battleground activities. 

# What does the bot do ?

- Update overall battleground status.
- Make a notification when battlegrounds start popping.

# How does the bot work ? 

- Automatic detection with Discord Game Activity.
- Manual detection with Organizers. Organizers are trustworthy active motivated players who make PvP alive and organize raids, bg parties and events IG.


## What are the commands ? 

**Here are the commands Users can do : **

- `!status` : To have the current status of all battlegrounds.
- `!jackpot` : To have the official jackpot schedule by Gameforge.
- `!help` : To have the list of all available commands.
- `!troll` : To have funny reply by the bot.

**Here are the commands Administrators can do : **

- `!init #channel` : To change the channel where the Battleground notifications and Battleground status are sent.
- `!notif on/off` : To enable or disabled battleground notifications on your server. Does not affect battleground status update.

**Here are the commands Organizers can do : **

- `!pop bgName` :  To manually trigger Battleground notifications and Battleground status update for all servers.
- `!cancel bgName` : To manually remove Battleground notifications for all servers.

## How can I get it ? 

To get the bot, use this link : https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=679747405285163039&permissions=215040&scope=bot

You will get redirected to Web Discord and you will be able to add discord in one of your server (You have to be Admin on this server).

Once the bot is added, you have to configure the bot on one of your channel. This channel will be used by the bot to make announcement, to update general status, etc : 
- Add bot permissions to the channel (Read Messages, Send Messages, Embed Links, Read Message History, Mention everyone).
- Use the command `!init #channel` (in a channel where the bot can read you).
